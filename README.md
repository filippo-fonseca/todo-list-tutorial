# ❄️ TypeScript Template for NextJS

A starter template for using [TypeScript](https://threejs.org) with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) & server-side rendering (SSR) quickly and out-of-the-box so you can focus on what really matters - programming, not setup & config.

**NOTE:** This template does not intend to infringe on any other templates or the NextJS framework. It is purely what I (Filippo Fonseca) use for my TypeScript + NextJS projects, as I wanted to have a quick and easy way to be able to access this type of configuration while helping others obtain it in the process through OSS. Let me know if you have any problems, issues, or queries.

## Getting Started

First, click the `Use this template` button on this GitHub repository and clone your respective (newly created) repository to your local machine.

Next, install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm i
```

**NOTE:** You can use either Yarn or npm, although it is recommended to use Yarn for this project (as it is the standard for NextJS-based projects).

Lastly, let's run the development server!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The following starter page should be rendered on the screen with the default boilerplate code for this template, as such:

<kbd><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDQrGXN/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-16-00-29.png" /></kbd>

You can now start editing the page and your app by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Feel free to make it your own (treat it like a normal app generated with `npx create-next-app` or `yarn create next-app`).

## Contributing

Pull requests, issues, discussions, etc. are always welcome!
